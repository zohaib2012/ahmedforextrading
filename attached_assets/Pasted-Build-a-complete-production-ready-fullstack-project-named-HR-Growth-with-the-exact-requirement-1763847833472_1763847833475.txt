  - Phone (required, validated)
  - Country (default+only option: Pakistan)
  - Course select (Forex / AI Automation)
- On submit:
  - Frontend validate (client-side) then POST to `/api/register`.
  - Show toast popup success message on success.
  - Form clears on success.
- Also handle server-side validation errors gracefully.

FRONTEND ROUTES
- / (Home)
- /services
- /courses
- /register
- /admin (Admin panel — protected route)

BACKEND — EXPRESS API (exact endpoints)
- Env vars:
  - MONGODB_URI
  - JWT_SECRET
  - PORT

APIs
1) POST /api/register
   - Body: { name, email, phone, country, course }
   - Validate input; save to MongoDB collection `students`:
     { name, email, phone, country, course, createdAt: ISOString }
   - Return 201 + registration object (omit internal fields).

2) POST /api/admin/login
   - Credentials EXACT:
     - Username: TRADINGDESK
     - Password: TRADINGDESK0099
   - On success return JWT (expires e.g., 8h). Use same JWT_SECRET.
   - Rate-limit this endpoint (e.g., 5 attempts / 15min).

3) GET /api/admin/registrations
   - JWT protected. Returns list of student registrations sorted by createdAt desc.
   - Support query params: search (name/email), page, limit.
   - Field selection: name, email, phone, course, createdAt.

4) POST /api/track-visit
   - Use session or cookie to ensure increment only once per user session (set cookie `hrg_visited_today` with expiry at midnight server time).
   - Increment today's count in `visitors` collection or a suitable document.

5) GET /api/stats/visitors
   - Return { today: number, total: number }.

DATABASE SCHEMA (MongoDB)
- students:
  - _id, name, email, phone, country, course, createdAt
  - Index on email for uniqueness optional.
- visitors:
  - { date: "YYYY-MM-DD", count: Number } or a single doc for totals with daily subdocs.

ADMIN PANEL (React)
- Login screen (username + password). Use provided credentials.
- After login:
  - Table of registrations (columns: name, email, phone, course, createdAt)
    - Pagination, server-side search by name/email.
    - Export CSV button (exports visible rows).
  - Visitor stats:
    - Today count + total visits display cards.
    - 7-day visitor chart (line chart) — use charting library (Recharts) or simple SVG.
  - Protect routes: store token in memory/localStorage and attach Authorization header `Bearer <token>`.
  - Logout button clears token.
- Admin table must be crisp & readable: compact rows, responsive.

VISITOR TRACKING & COOKIE RULES
- When frontend loads it should call POST /api/track-visit once per session.
- Use cookie name `hrg_visit` with value and expiry at server midnight; backend should check cookie to avoid double-count.
- Backend should increment `visitors` collection by date.

UX / SIZING RULES (fixes you asked for)
- Banner texts must follow the specified font sizes — NOT oversized.
- Header/footer must be normal heights (header 72px desktop, footer ~120px) — not huge blocks.
- Buttons and CTAs sized using Tailwind padding classes (px-4 py-2 for primary, px-3 py-1.5 for secondary).
- Spacing: use Tailwind spacing scale (p-4, p-6, gap-6 etc.). Avoid huge paddings that look like empty blocks.
- On mobile reduce hero title size and stack CTAs vertically with spacing.
- Hamburger must be a functioning `<button>` controlling a drawer with proper aria attributes and focus trap.

PERFORMANCE & OTHER REQUIREMENTS
- Lazy-load images, compress assets, minify production build.
- Use server-side pagination for admin registrations.
- Add basic unit tests for critical backend routes (optional but preferred).
- Add E2E/Integration tests for register flow (optional).

SECURITY
- Validate and sanitize all inputs on server.
- Hash admin password? (We have fixed creds; still compare securely).
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Use CORS restrict to allowed origins.

EXACT COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR DEVELOPERS / AI:
"Build 'HR Growth' — a fullstack React + Tailwind frontend and Node/Express + MongoDB backend using the exact specifications in this message. Use the black theme with green and white accents.

Provide README and ensure production build is minified and accessible."
